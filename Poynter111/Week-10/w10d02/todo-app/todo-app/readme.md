# React Component Lab

## Exercise

- Set up a React app and test that it works
- Build 1 smart component which contains all the data for the page in `state`
- Build 3 dumb components to display:
  + information about this exhibit
  + general operation information, like hours, address, phone number, etc.
  + information for donors, like contact information for the head of the museum, what sort of donations are accepted, etc.
- Pass the relevant from the smart component to the dumb components via `props`

#### Deliverable

A simple hardcoded React app with 3 component files, an app file, and an `index.html`
